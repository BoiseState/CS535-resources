## Overview

Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple of sentences, you're going
too far. Generally you should be pulling this right from the project specification. I don't
want you to just cut and paste, but paraphrase what is stated in the project specification.

## Reflection

Write a one or two paragraph reflection describing your experience with this project.  Talk about
what worked well and what was challenging.  Did you run into an issue that took some time to
figure out?  Tell us about it. What did you enjoy, what was less desirable? Feel free to add
other items (within the two paragraph limit).

## Compiling and Using

Instruct the user how build, package and use your code. Does your program require user input? If
so, what does your user need to know about it to use it as quickly as possible?

## Results 

This section presents timing and other results of the experiments that you were asked to perform
as part of the project.

## Sources used

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files, or text book you need
to list them here.
